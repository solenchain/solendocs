# Staking

Solen uses proof-of-stake consensus where validators and delegators stake SOLEN tokens to secure the network and earn rewards.

## Validators

Validators run nodes, propose blocks, and participate in consensus.

| Parameter | Default | Governance |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Minimum self-stake | 500,000 SOLEN | Configurable via `propose_set_min_validator_stake` |
| Unbonding period | 7 epochs | Configurable via `propose_set_unbonding_period` |
| Slashing (double sign) | 10% of stake + jailing | — |
| Slashing (downtime) | 1% after 50 missed blocks | — |
| Slashing destination | Foundation Treasury | — |
| Default commission | 10% (1000 bps) | — |
| Genesis validator lock | ~1 year (157,680 epochs) | — |

Current on-chain values are displayed on the [explorer homepage](https://solenscan.io).

### Becoming a Validator

Register as a validator via the staking system contract:

```bash
solen --chain-id 9000 register-validator <keyname> 500000
```

This stakes 500,000 SOLEN as self-stake and registers your account as a validator. The validator joins the active consensus set at the next epoch boundary (every 100 blocks) and begins earning rewards one epoch after that.

See [Running a Node — Becoming a Validator](../tools/running-a-node.md#becoming-a-validator) for the full setup guide.

### Validator Rewards

Validators earn from two sources:

1. **Epoch rewards** — Distributed from the staking allocation at each epoch boundary, proportional to total stake (self-stake + delegations)
2. **Transaction fees** — The treasury share of fees (50%) is governed by on-chain governance and can be directed to validators

### Reward Calculation

Each epoch, a fixed reward pool is distributed across all active validators:

```
validator_reward = epoch_reward_pool × (validator_total_stake / network_total_stake)
```

## Delegators

Any token holder can delegate to a validator without running infrastructure.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Minimum delegation | No minimum |
| Reward share | Proportional to stake relative to validator's total |
| Unbonding period | 7 epochs (same as validators) |
| Slashing risk | Shared with chosen validator |

### Delegator Rewards

Within a validator, rewards are split proportionally:

```
delegator_reward = validator_reward × (delegator_stake / validator_total_stake)
```

### Choosing a Validator

Delegators should consider:

- **Uptime** — Validators with downtime get slashed, affecting delegators
- **Commission** — Validators may charge a percentage of delegator rewards
- **Stake concentration** — Distributing delegation improves decentralization

## Slashing

### Double Signing

Signing two different blocks at the same height:

- **10% stake penalty** — Applied to validator and all delegators proportionally
- **Jailing** — Validator removed from the active set

### Downtime

Missing 50 consecutive blocks:

- **1% stake penalty** — Applied to validator and delegators
- **Jailing** — Validator removed from the active set

### Unjailing

A jailed validator (whether from downtime or double signing) can be reactivated by submitting an `unjail` transaction:

```bash
solen unjail <keyname>
```

The validator rejoins the active consensus set at the next epoch boundary. Slashed funds are sent to the **Foundation Treasury** and can be restored via a [governance proposal](governance.md) if the community votes to do so.

> **Note:** Slashing is deterministic and on-chain — penalties are executed as system transactions within blocks, not applied out-of-band.

## Unbonding

When undelegating, tokens enter a 7-epoch unbonding period before they can be transferred. During unbonding:

- Tokens do not earn rewards
- Tokens are still subject to slashing
- The unbonding period provides security against long-range attacks

## Target Staking Ratio

The network targets **40-60%** of circulating supply staked:

- Below 40%: Governance may increase epoch rewards
- Above 60%: Governance may decrease rewards
